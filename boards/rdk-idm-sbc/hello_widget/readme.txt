Hello using Widgets

A very simple ``hello world'' example written using the Stellaris Graphics
Library widgets.  It displays a button which, when pressed, toggles
display of the words ``Hello World!'' on the screen.  This may be used as
a starting point for more complex widget-based applications.

This application supports remote software update over Ethernet using the
LM Flash Programmer application.  A firmware update is initiated using the
remote update request ``magic packet'' from LM Flash Programmer.
