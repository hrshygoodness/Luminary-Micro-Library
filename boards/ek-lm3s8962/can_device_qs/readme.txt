CAN Device Board Quickstart Application

This application uses the CAN controller to communicate with the evaluation
board that is running the example game.  It receives messages over CAN to
turn on, turn off, or to pulse the LED on the device board.  It also sends
CAN messages when either of the up and down buttons are pressed or
released.
