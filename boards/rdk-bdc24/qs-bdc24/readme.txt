24 Volt Brushed DC Motor Controller

This application controls a brushed DC motor.  Three communication methods
are supported; a hobby servo-style input for basic voltage control, a
standard UART interface or a CAN interface are also available for more
advanced control (the inputs are mutually exclusive).

When using any of the communication methods, a basic voltage control mode
is available.  In this mode, the external controller directly specifies the
desired output voltage.  When using CAN or UART, an output voltage slew
rate can be specified, which results in the output voltage adjusting in a
linear fashion from the current voltage to the new voltage (as opposed to
directly jumping to the new voltage if the slew rate is disabled).

Additional advanced control methods are also available when using the CAN
or UART communication interfaces.  There are voltage compensation control
mode, current control mode, speed control mode, and position control mode.
Each of these modes is mutually exclusive and operating using a PID
controller whose gains are fully programmable via the CAN or UART
interface.  Each PID controller starts with all of its gains set to zero,
so no output voltage will be generated by any of these modes until the PID
controller is at least partially configured.

In voltage compensation control mode, the output duty cycle is adjusted to
compensate for changes in the input voltage, resulting in a constant
voltage output.

In speed control mode, the speed of the motor is measured using the
quadrature encoder input.  Only PHA is used for measuring the speed, so it
can be used with gear tooth sensors as well (which only provide a single
pulse stream, not a quadrature pair as provided by a shaft encoder).

In position control mode, the position of the motor can be measured using
the quadrature encoder input or the analog input.  When using the analog
input, a 10K potentiometer must be coupled to the output shaft of the motor
(either before or after gearing) in some manner so that the motor position
can be tracked.

The status of the motor controller can also be monitored over the CAN or
UART interfaces.  The bus voltage, output voltage, motor current, ambient
temperature, speed, position, limit switch values, fault status, power
status, and firmware version can all be queried.
