Capacitive Touch Example

An example that works with the 430BOOST-SENSE1 capactive sense 
BoosterPack, originally designed for the MSP430 LaunchPad.  

The Stellaris LM4F120H5QR does not have the capacitive sense hardware
assisted peripheral features of some MSP430 chips. Therefore it is
required that the user install surface mount resistors on the pads
provided on the bottom of the capacitive sense BoosterPack. Resistor values
of 30 ohms are recommended. Calibration may be required for
resistor values other than 30 ohms.
