USB HID Keyboard Host

This application demonstrates the handling of a USB keyboard attached to
the evaluation kit.  Once attached, text typed on the keyboard will appear
on the UART.  Any keyboard that supports the USB HID BIOS protocol is
supported.

UART0, connected to the FTDI virtual COM port and running at 115,200,
8-N-1, is used to display messages from this application.
