USB HID Mouse Device

This example application turns the evaluation board into a USB mouse
supporting the Human Interface Device class.  Dragging a finger or stylus
over the touchscreen translates into mouse movement and presses on marked
areas at the bottom of the screen indicate mouse button press. This input
is used to generate messages in HID reports sent to the USB host allowing
the evaluation board to control the mouse pointer on the host system.
