Note: This license file was taken from PolarSSL-0.10.1 and modified by
      Texas Instruments with permission by Paul Bakker of PolarSSL
      (http://www.polarssl.com). The only change is to allow redistributions
      in embedded binaries to only have a "published" copyright and license
      notice via a website. This is because embedded applications do not
      generally have copyright displays and often do not have published
      documentation (as they are part of a larger system).
